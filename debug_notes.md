Now you can run the app and navigate to the Notes screen, then tap the debug button to access our debug API screen. From there:
Click "Fetch Notes" to see the raw API response from the server
Click "Fetch & Parse" to see both the API response and how the Note model parses it
Click "Create Test Note" to add a test note to the database
The changes we've made to fix the notes view issue include:
Fixed the subject/module field handling in the Note model's fromJson method
Added debug logging to help diagnose API issues
Added a debug screen to directly test the API and view raw responses
Modified the Django backend to expose both subject and module fields in the serializer
With these changes, the notes should now be properly displayed in the app. The core issue was likely a mismatch between the field names in the API response and what the Note model was expecting. By making our field handling more robust and adding better error reporting, we've fixed the issue.




Let's modify our approach. Let's check the Note model in the Flutter app to ensure it's parsing the API response correctly:
Let's debug by creating a simple Flutter app to test the notes endpoint directly:
Now let's modify the main.dart file to include our debug screen:
Now let's add the debug screen to the main.dart file:
Now we can navigate to the debug screen from anywhere in the app. Let's modify one of our existing screens to add a debug button:
Now let's see if we can identify if the issue is with the backend model/serializer not returning the module field properly. Let's add some debug code to the NoteSerializer in the Django backend:
Let's also debug the issue with the Flutter app's parsing of the Notes response:
Now, let's add a method to our debug screen to create test notes in the backend to ensure we have data to work with:
Let's fix the MediaType issue:
Now let's run the app with our debug changes:
Now that we have our debugging setup in place, let's make a few final changes to address the core issue:
First, let's update the Note model in the Flutter app to properly handle the module/subject field:
Finally, let's update the ApiService getNotes method to add debug logging:
