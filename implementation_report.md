# Featured Exams Implementation Report

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the "Featured Exams" functionality for the home screen. This feature allows administrators to mark certain exams as featured, which will then appear on the home screen of the mobile app.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Model Updates**:
   - Added `show_on_home` boolean field to the `Exam` model in `admindashboard/models.py`
   - Created a migration file (`0010_exam_show_on_home.py`) for the model change

2. **Admin Interface Updates**:
   - Updated `ExamForm` in `admindashboard/forms.py` to include the new field
   - Updated the exam form template to include a checkbox for featuring exams
   - Updated the exam table template to show which exams are featured

3. **API Updates**:
   - Added `FeaturedExamsViewSet` to `api/views.py`
   - Registered the API endpoint in `api/urls.py`
   - Updated the `ExamSerializer` to include the new field

### Frontend Changes (Already Implemented)

1. **API Service**:
   - Added `getFeaturedExams()` method to `ApiService`

2. **Home Screen**:
   - Added a new `_featuredExams` list and loading state
   - Added a method to load featured exams from the API
   - Created a `_buildFeaturedExamsSection()` method to display featured exams
   - Implemented navigation to exam details on tap

## Documentation

1. Created `home.md` with a detailed implementation plan
2. Updated `documentation.md` with details about the home screen enhancements
3. Created `backend_instructions.md` with detailed instructions for the backend developer
4. Created `README_FEATURED_EXAMS.md` with instructions on how to apply the backend changes
5. Updated `summary.md` to reflect the completed implementation

## How to Deploy

1. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Restart the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. Log in to the admin dashboard and edit some exams to mark them as "show_on_home"

4. Test the API endpoint by accessing `/api/featured-exams/`

5. Test the Flutter app to ensure featured exams appear on the home screen

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Apply the migration successfully
- [ ] Mark at least 3 exams as featured in the admin dashboard
- [ ] Verify that the API endpoint returns only featured and published exams
- [ ] Verify that the Flutter app displays the featured exams on the home screen
- [ ] Test navigation from featured exams to exam details
- [ ] Test error handling when the API fails
- [ ] Test empty state when no featured exams are available

## Conclusion

The "Featured Exams" functionality has been successfully implemented in both the backend and frontend. This feature enhances the user experience by providing quick access to important exams directly from the home screen.

The implementation follows the same pattern as the existing featured content sections (jobs, events, news), ensuring consistency across the application. The admin interface allows administrators to easily control which exams appear on the home screen.

With this implementation, we have completed all the tasks outlined in the home screen implementation plan.
